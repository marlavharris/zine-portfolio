  <p class="meta">By Marla Harris · Long read</p>

  <div class="columns">
    <p class="pull">TikTok’s protest migration to Red Note surfaced a gap in U.S. media literacy — and a window for state-aligned storytelling.</p>
    <p>As an act of protest, TikTok users migrated en masse to Red Note, a Chinese-owned social media and shopping app operated from within China. The move reflected frustration with the U.S. government’s decision to let the TikTok ban proceed without clearly articulating the risks associated with the platform. Banning TikTok had material consequences for U.S. users, many of whom relied on it for income. In protest, they downloaded Red Note, placing their data in the hands of a Chinese company operating under Chinese law, while rejecting what they saw as U.S. government hypocrisy around political overreach, free speech, and vaguely defined data privacy concerns. In doing so, users entered a platform shaped by Chinese state control, often without understanding the implications. U.S. users’ limited media literacy and minimal understanding of China’s political system created an opening for Chinese networks to selectively amplify content aligned with state narratives and geopolitical goals.</p><p>DFRLab, a research organization affiliated with the Atlantic Council, claimed that the migration to Red Note created new vulnerabilities. According to DFRLab, “We pay particular attention to the narratives promoted by Chinese state media sources, finding that overall, the CCP has used the opportunity to criticize the United States and portray China as innovative, welcoming, and non-threatening.” These comparisons reinforced narratives of Chinese prosperity and American decline. Red Note users posted cheap grocery hauls and fresh food, while Americans struggled to afford basic items like eggs. This implanted seeds of doubt in users’ minds and shifted their perspective on life in China. At the same time, U.S. users were banned after unknowingly violating Red Note’s terms of service, even while engaging with content portraying the U.S. as hostile to free expression. Though brief, the ban was an opportunity to promote content that framed the U.S. as untrustworthy and unstable.</p><p>One of China’s long-standing goals is to shift global perceptions of its manufacturing base. The aim is not only to serve as a site of low-cost production but to be recognized for technological expertise, design innovation, and luxury manufacturing. The migration of U.S. users to Red Note offered a chance to reframe this image. Across platforms, users encountered content showing Chinese factory workers producing what appeared to be luxury handbags, often priced around $200, with captions claiming the same factories supplied brands like Hermès and Chanel. The message was clear: “Made in China” could mean the same thing as “Made in Italy,” with Western brands charging markups based on name alone.</p><p>Business of Fashion noted that this wave of viral content challenged the long-standing link between China and mass-market goods, instead presenting Chinese labor as high-skilled and underrecognized. The posts reframed Western luxury as branding, not craftsmanship. Though many of the claims were misleading, their popularity revealed a growing skepticism about luxury pricing and origin. Analyst Luca Solca called the trend an “orchestrated assault,” suggesting that what looked like user-generated content may have functioned as coordinated messaging. By conflating Chinese manufacturing with craftsmanship, China fulfilled both an economic goal and a reputational one, positioning itself as a contender in the luxury sector while diminishing the symbolic power of legacy Western brands in the eyes of younger consumers.</p><p>This strategy aligns with China’s broader ambitions. In a 2020 speech published in Qiushi, Xi Jinping emphasized the need to “take advantage of this favorable momentum, accelerate construction of the digital economy, digital society and digital government, promote digitalization-based optimization and upgrading in all fields.” These directives reflect a push to position China not only as a manufacturing power, but as a global leader in technological governance. Lifestyle media and content is part of this strategy. Social media platforms function as both consumer tools and vehicles for exporting curated narratives and collecting user data.</p><p>This tactic intersects consumer psychology and generational shifts. Mitch Presnick and James B. Estes, writing in Harvard Business Review, argue that China’s rising middle class and flexible economy give it an edge in global competition. They cite a Bain report projecting that Chinese consumers will account for 40 percent of global luxury spending by 2030. In 2022, the Chinese luxury e-commerce market was valued at $74 billion. Before the pandemic, Chinese tourists made up 40 percent of Europe’s luxury spending. While Chinese consumers continue to recognize the symbolic value of luxury, U.S. consumers have grown skeptical of brand legitimacy. The value of luxury lies less in material quality than in the power of the brand name. Once that name is compromised, the product’s meaning and appeal diminish. Luxury has never been solely about craftsmanship; it has always been about what ownership represents.</p><p>The migration to Red Note highlights a deeper problem in American media literacy. It showed how easily content can be absorbed and used to advance another country’s political and economic goals. Users frustrated by the TikTok ban moved to an app governed by a different legal and ideological framework, without fully understanding what that shift meant. Videos about luxury and daily life reframed China’s manufacturing capacity, standard of living, and global role in ways that served state interests.</p>
